Description: Perform multistage deterministic linkages, apply case definitions to datasets, and deduplicate records.
    Records are linked by different matching criteria in a specified order of certainty. 
    The linkage process handles missing data and conflicting matches using this same order.
    Track events (e.g. sample collection) and period (e.g. hospital admission) to episodes. 
    This process permits several options such as episode lengths and recurrence.
    Record linkage and episode tracking assign unique group identifiers to matched records.
    This then allows for record deduplication or sub-analyses within these groups.
