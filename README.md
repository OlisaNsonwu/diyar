Deduplication of individual-level data, such as repeated spells in hospital, or recurrent cases of infection is a common task in healthcare research and in other fields of research. 
The diyar package aims to simplify the assignment of identifiers that group repeat occurrences under the same individual. 

diyar also aims to make deterministic linkage of records between different datasets easier.
