# Overview

Record linkage and deduplication of individual-level data, such as repeated spells in hospital, or recurrent cases of infection is a common task in healthcare research and in other fields of research. 

The diyar package aims to simplify the assignment of unique identifiers for matching records and repeat occurrences within a specified period.

# Installation

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("OlisaNsonwu/diyar")
```

## Usage

This package has two functions; `record_group()` and `episode_group()`. 
Please visit [here](https://olisansonwu.github.io/diyar/index.html) for an introduction to both.
