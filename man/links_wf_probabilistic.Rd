\description{
A specific use case of \code{links} for probabilistic record linkage.
}
\details{
\code{links_wf_probabilistic} is a wrapper function of \code{\link{links}} for probabilistic record linkage.
Its implementation is based on Fellegi and Sunter (1969) model for deciding if two records belong to the same entity.

In summary, each record pairs are created and categorised as matches and non-matches (\code{cmp_func}).
Two probabilities (\code{m} and \code{u}) are then estimated for each record pair to score matches and non-matches.
The \code{m}-probability is the probability that matched records are from the same entity,
while \code{u}-probability is the probability that matched records are not from the same entity.
\code{m}-probabilities must be supplied but \code{u}-probabilities are calculated for each value of an \code{attribute}.
This is calculated as the frequency of each value in the dataset.
Record pairs whose total score are above a certain threshold (\code{score_threshold}) are assumed to belong to the same entity.

Agreement and disagreement scores are calculated as described by Asher et al. (2020).

For each record pair, an agreement or match score for attribute \eqn{i} is calculated as;

\deqn{\log_{2}(m_{i}/u_{i})}{log_2 (m_i / u_i)}

For each record pair, a disagreement or non-match score for attribute \eqn{i} is calculated as;

\deqn{\log_{2}((1-m_{i})/(1-u_{i}))}{log_2 ((1-m_i) / (1-u_i))}

where \eqn{m_{i}}{m_i} and \eqn{u_{i}}{u_i} are the \code{m} and \code{u}-probabilities for each value of attribute \eqn{i}.

Missing data (\code{NA}) are categorised as non-matches and assigned a \code{u}-probability of \code{0}.

By default, matches and non-matches for each \code{attribute} are determined as an \code{\link{exact_match}} with a binary outcome.
String comparators can also be used with thresholds (\code{cmp_threshold}) for each similarity score.
If \code{probabilistic} is \code{FALSE},
the sum of all similarity scores is used as the final score instead of deriving one from the \code{m} and \code{u}-probabilities.

\code{links_wf_probabilistic} requires a \code{score_threshold} in advance of the linkage process.
This differs from the typical approach where a \code{score_threshold} is selected after the linkage process,
following a review of all calculated scores.
To help with this, \code{prob_score_range} will return the range of scores attainable for a given set of attributes.
Additionally, \code{id_1} and \code{id_2} can be used to link specific records pairs using, aiding the review of potential scores.

A \code{blocking_attribute} can be used to reduce processing time by restricting comparisons to \code{strata} of the dataset.
