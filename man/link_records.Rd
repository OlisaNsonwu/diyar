\description{
Deterministic and probabilistic record linkage with partial or evaluated matches.
}
\details{
\code{link_records()} and \code{links_wf_probabilistic()} are functions to implement probabilistic record linkage.
\code{link_records()} compares every record-pair in one instance,
while \code{links_wf_probabilistic()} is a wrapper function of \code{\link{links}} and so compares batches of record-pairs in iterations.

\code{link_records()} is more thorough in the sense that it compares every combination of record-pairs.
This makes it faster but is memory intensive, particularly if there's no \code{blocking_attribute}.
In contrast, \code{links_wf_probabilistic()} is less memory intensive but takes longer since it compares batches of record-pairs in iterations.

The implementation of probabilistic record linkage is based on Fellegi and Sunter (1969) model for deciding if two records belong to the same entity.

In summary, record-pairs are created and categorised as matches and non-matches (\code{attr_threshold}) with user-defined functions (\code{cmp_func}).
Two probabilities (\code{m} and \code{u}) are then estimated for each record-pair to score the matches and non-matches.
The \code{m}-probability is the probability that matched records are actually from the same entity i.e. a true match,
while \code{u}-probability is the probability that matched records are not from the same entity i.e. a false match.
By default, \code{u}-probabilities are calculated as the frequency of each value of an \code{attribute} however,
they can also be supplied along with \code{m}-probabilities.
Record-pairs whose total score are above a certain threshold (\code{score_threshold}) are assumed to belong to the same entity.

Agreement (match) and disagreement (non-match) scores are calculated as described by Asher et al. (2020).

For each record pair, an agreement for attribute \eqn{i} is calculated as;

\deqn{\log_{2}(m_{i}/u_{i})}{log_2 (m_i / u_i)}

For each record pair, a disagreement score for attribute \eqn{i} is calculated as;

\deqn{\log_{2}((1-m_{i})/(1-u_{i}))}{log_2 ((1-m_i) / (1-u_i))}

where \eqn{m_{i}}{m_i} and \eqn{u_{i}}{u_i} are the \code{m} and \code{u}-probabilities for each value of attribute \eqn{i}.

Missing data (\code{NA}) are considered non-matches and assigned a \code{u}-probability of \code{0}.

By default, matches and non-matches for each \code{attribute} are determined as an \code{\link{exact_match}} with a binary outcome.
Alternatively, user-defined functions (\code{cmp_func}) are used to create similarity scores.
Pairs with similarity scores within (\code{attr_threshold}) are then considered matches for the corresponding \code{attribute}.

If \code{probabilistic} is \code{FALSE},
the sum of all similarity scores is used as the \code{score_threshold} instead of deriving one from the \code{m} and \code{u}-probabilities.

A \code{blocking_attribute} can be used to reduce the processing time by restricting comparisons to subsets of the dataset.

In \code{link_records()}, \code{score_threshold} is a convenience argument because every combination of record-pairs are returned
therefore, a new \code{score_threshold} can be selected after reviewing the final scores.
However, in \code{links_wf_probabilistic()}, the \code{score_threshold} is more important
because a final selection is made at each iteration.

As a result, \code{links_wf_probabilistic()} requires an acceptable \code{score_threshold} in advance.
To help with this, \code{prob_score_range()} can be used to return the range of scores attainable for a given set of \code{attribute}, \code{m} and \code{u}-probabilities.
Additionally, \code{id_1} and \code{id_2} can be used to link specific records pairs, aiding the review of potential scores.
